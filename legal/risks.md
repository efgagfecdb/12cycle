# Risk Factors

## ⚠️ Mandatory Reading for Investors

Before investing in the 12cycle project or acquiring 12C tokens, you must thoroughly understand and acknowledge the following risk factors.

---

## 📉 Market Risks

### 1. Cryptocurrency Market Volatility

Digital assets, including the 12C token, are subject to extreme price volatility. Token prices may fluctuate significantly due to various factors including:
- Market sentiment and speculation
- Regulatory developments
- Technological changes
- Macroeconomic conditions
- Trading volume and liquidity

Participants may experience substantial or total loss of their investment.

### 2. Liquidity Risk

There is no guarantee that 12C tokens will be listed on cryptocurrency exchanges or that sufficient liquidity will be available. Even if listed, market depth may be insufficient, potentially resulting in:
- Inability to sell tokens at desired prices
- Large price slippage on trades
- Extended periods of low trading activity
- Delisting from exchanges

### 3. Competition Risk

The blockchain and digital content industries are highly competitive. Numerous projects with similar or superior features may emerge, potentially resulting in:
- Reduced market share and user adoption
- Decreased token demand and value
- Project obsolescence
- Loss of competitive advantage

## 🔧 Technical Risks

### 1. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities

Smart contracts may contain bugs, errors, or vulnerabilities that could result in:
- Loss or theft of tokens
- Unauthorized access to funds
- Malfunctioning of ecosystem features
- Exploitation by malicious actors

While smart contracts undergo professional audits, no audit can guarantee complete security or eliminate all risks.

### 2. Blockchain Infrastructure Dependency

The 12cycle ecosystem relies on underlying blockchain networks (Arbitrum, Ethereum, etc.). Risks include:
- Network congestion and high transaction fees
- Hard forks or protocol changes
- Network attacks or failures
- Discontinuation of underlying blockchain support

### 3. Scalability Issues

As the user base grows, the ecosystem may face scalability challenges:
- Network congestion during high activity
- Performance degradation
- Increased transaction costs
- User experience deterioration

### 4. Cybersecurity Threats

The project faces ongoing cybersecurity risks including:
- Hacking attempts and data breaches
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
- Wallet compromises
- Phishing and social engineering attacks
- Private key theft

### 3. Exchange Regulation

Cryptocurrency exchanges face increasing regulatory scrutiny, which may result in:
- Exchange shutdowns or restrictions
- Delisting of 12C tokens
- Limited access for users in certain jurisdictions
- Reduced trading volume and liquidity

### 4. Tax Uncertainty

Tax treatment of cryptocurrency transactions varies significantly across jurisdictions and is subject to change. Token holders may:
- Face unexpected tax liabilities
- Encounter complex tax reporting requirements
- Be subject to audits or penalties
- Experience changes in tax treatment affecting token economics
