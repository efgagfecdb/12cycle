# Proof of Culture

The core mechanism of the 12cycle ecosystem is the **"Proof of Culture" (PoC)**. This mechanism transforms user engagement into tangible value.

## 🐉 The Power of 12 Zodiac Legends

**12cycle** is built upon the universal cultural heritage of the **12 Zodiac Animals (十二支)** — a mythology shared across East Asian cultures (China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam) and recognized globally. These 12 characters serve as the foundation for:

*   **Cultural IP Expansion:** Each zodiac animal becomes a unique character with stories, games, and webtoons.
*   **Cross-Cultural Appeal:** The zodiac system transcends language barriers, making it accessible to diverse audiences.
*   **Infinite Scalability:** From rat to pig, each character can evolve into its own sub-universe.

## 🧬 How It Works

Unlike traditional platforms where user data is siloed, 12cycle verifies and rewards cultural activities across applications.

1.  **Participation:** Users play 12cycle-IP games, read webtoons, or collect NFTs featuring the 12 zodiac characters.
2.  **Verification:** The activity is verified on-chain as a "Cultural Transaction."
3.  **Reward:** Users earn **12C tokens** as proof of their contribution to the cultural ecosystem.

> 💡 **Utility:** The earned 12C tokens act as a "Ticket" or "Passport" to access higher-tier content, exclusive merchandise, and governance rights within the DAO.

## 🎨 From Folklore to Digital Economy

The **12C token** is not just a currency — it's a **Cultural Certificate**. Every transaction represents:

*   A user engaging with zodiac-themed content (games, stories, art)
*   A creator producing new cultural works based on the 12 legends
*   A community member voting on which character gets the next expansion

This creates a self-sustaining loop where **cultural consumption = economic value**.
