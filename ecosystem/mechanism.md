# Proof of Culture

The core mechanism of the 12cycle ecosystem is the **"Proof of Culture" (PoC)**. This mechanism transforms user engagement into tangible value.

## 🧬 How It Works

Unlike traditional platforms where user data is siloed, 12cycle verifies and rewards cultural activities across applications.

1.  **Participation:** Users play 12cycle-IP games or read webtoons.
2.  **Verification:** The activity is verified on-chain as a "Cultural Transaction."
3.  **Reward:** Users earn **12C tokens** as proof of their contribution.

> 💡 **Utility:** The earned 12C tokens act as a "Ticket" or "Passport" to access higher-tier content, exclusive merchandise, and governance rights within the DAO.
