# Proof of Culture

The core mechanism of the 12cycle ecosystem is the **"Proof of Culture" (PoC)**.

##  The 12 Zodiacs

12cycle is built upon the cultural heritage of the **12 Zodiac Animals**.

| Animal | Concept |
| :--- | :--- |
|  **Rat** | Pioneer |
|  **Ox** | Worker |
|  **Tiger** | Warrior |
|  **Rabbit** | Dreamer |
|  **Dragon** | Ruler |
|  **Snake** | Mystic |
|  **Horse** | Spirit |
|  **Sheep** | Guardian |
|  **Monkey** | Trickster |
|  **Rooster** | Herald |
|  **Dog** | Friend |
|  **Pig** | Fortune |

##  How It Works

1.  **Participation:** Users engage with 12cycle-IP content (games, webtoons, NFTs).
2.  **Verification:** Activity is verified as a "Cultural Transaction".
3.  **Reward:** Users earn **12C tokens** as proof of contribution.

##  Value Proposition

The **12C token** acts as a **Cultural Certificate**, creating a loop where cultural consumption generates economic value.
