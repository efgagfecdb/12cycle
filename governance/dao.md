# The Grand Council (DAO)

**12cycle** is not owned by a corporation but governed by its community. The **Grand Council** is the decision-making body where **12C** token holders shape the future.

## 🏛️ Governance Structure

The voting power is derived from the **12C** tokens staked in the governance contract.

### 1. Proposal Phase (The Agenda)
Any holder with more than **120,000 12C** can submit a proposal regarding:
* **IP Expansion:** "Which animal/character should get a new skin or story arc?"
* **Ecosystem Grants:** "Which webtoon artist should receive funding?"

### 2. Voting Phase (The Voice)
* **1 Token = 1 Vote:** Simple majority rules.
* **Quorum:** A proposal needs at least 12% participation to be valid.

## 🛡️ Treasury Management
A portion of the ecosystem revenue is deposited into the **Community Treasury**. The Council votes on how to use these funds.
