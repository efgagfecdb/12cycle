**"Connecting Cultures, Cycling Value"**

12cycle is a blockchain-based cultural project that reinterprets the traditional **12 Zodiacs** into a universal standard. We aim to create a borderless digital culture ecosystem where anyone can participate and prove their cultural contributions.

##  Core Concept

The **12cycle Coin (12C)** serves as evidence of participation in the cultural ecosystem. We utilize blockchain technology to create a **"Proof of Culture"** protocol, recording cultural contributions transparently.

##  Key Features

* **Universal IP:** 12 Zodiac characters designed for global scalability.
* **Proof of Culture:** On-chain verification of cultural activities (Webtoons, Games, etc.).
* **DAO Governance:** Community-driven decision making.
* **Multi-Chain:** Built on Arbitrum One (Layer 2) for efficiency.
