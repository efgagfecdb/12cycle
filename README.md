> **"Connecting Cultures, Cycling Value"**

**12cycle** is a blockchain-based cultural project that reinterprets the traditional **12 Zodiacs** into a universal standard. We aim to create a borderless digital culture ecosystem where anyone, from any background, can participate and prove their cultural contributions.

## 🌟 Why 12cycle?

The cultural industry faces fragmentation and lack of transparency. **12cycle** solves this by using blockchain technology to create a **"Proof of Culture"** protocol.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Key Concept:**
The **12cycle Coin** is not just a currency; it serves as **evidence** of your participation in the cultural ecosystem—whether it's gaming, creating webtoons, or collecting digital assets.
{% endhint %}

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Universal IP:** 12 Zodiac characters designed to resonate across Asian, Western, and global cultures.
* **Scalability:** From Webtoons and Games to the Metaverse and Physical Goods.
* **Transparency:** All cultural contributions and rewards are recorded on-chain.
* **Community-Driven:** DAO governance ensures the community shapes the future.
* **Cross-Chain:** Multi-chain support starting with Arbitrum, expanding to Polygon and Base.
