# Sustainability & Value Loop

A sustainable token economy requires strong demand and deflationary mechanisms. **12cycle** introduces the **"Cycle of Value"** to protect the token price.

## 🔥 Deflationary Mechanisms (Burn)

To combat inflation, we implement systematic token burning:

1.  **IP Licensing Fees:**
    * Whenever a third-party company uses the 12 Zodiac IP, the licensing fee is paid in **12C** and **permanently burned**.
2.  **Marketplace Tax:**
    * A 2.5% fee on all NFT trades is collected. 50% is burned, and 50% goes to the Treasury.
3.  **Gacha/Random Box:**
    * Using **12C** to open limited edition character boxes removes tokens from circulation.

## 💰 Revenue Stream
The project generates revenue through **In-Game Purchases**, **Media Contents**, and **Physical Goods**. As the universe expands, the circulating supply decreases.
