# Sustainability

**12cycle** implements a **"Cycle of Value"** to ensure long-term ecosystem health.

##  Deflationary Mechanisms

To combat inflation, we implement systematic token burning.

1.  **IP Licensing Fees:** A portion of licensing revenue is burned. (Ratio TBD)
2.  **Marketplace Tax:** A portion of NFT trading fees is burned.
3.  **Sinks:** Gacha, item purchases, and premium features remove tokens from circulation.

##  Emission Strategy

**Ecosystem Rewards Pool (40%)** is emitted over a multi-year schedule.

*   **Emission Schedule:** TBD (e.g., Halving or Linear decay).
*   **Goal:** Incentivize early adopters while ensuring long-term reserves.
